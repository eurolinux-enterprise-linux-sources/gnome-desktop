    <_p>GNOME is a Free, usable, stable, accessible desktop
environment for the Unix-like family of operating systems.</_p>
    <_p>GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer,
including the file manager, web browser, menus, and many
applications.</_p>
    <_p>GNOME also includes a complete development platform for
applications programmers, allowing the creation of powerful and
complex applications.</_p>
    <_p>GNOME's focus on usability and accessibility, regular release
cycle, and strong corporate backing make it unique among Free Software
desktops.</_p>
    <_p>GNOME's greatest strength is our strong community. Virtually
anyone, with or without coding skills, can contribute to making GNOME
better.</_p>
    <_p>Hundreds of people have contributed code to GNOME since it was started
in 1997; many more have contributed in other important ways, including
translations, documentation, and quality assurance.</_p>
